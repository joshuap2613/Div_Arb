    "Since we can put on a position daily we would be satisfied with anything like a .2% return (keep in mind that our profits only get compounded every 1.5 months since there is a 1.5 month delay before getting payment from the dividend. In fact we may slowly bleed liquidity until dividend payments start coming through)."
